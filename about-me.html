  <h1>Welcome to my About Me page!</h1>
  <h2>My name is Chloe O'Neil!</h2>
  <p>I was the founder and owner of a successful dog walking business called Chloe and Canines. I enjoyed that position for 5 years.</p>
  <p>Software development has always intrigued me; and as the world is constantly changing and evolving, the one thing that has remained true is that the web isn't going anywhere but up!</p>
  <p>I like to believe I am a connoisseur of hobby collecting. I have done almost every type of craft, love learning new things and I am an avid bargain hunter.</p>
